Early in the week, specific pockets like Auto (ASHOKLEY) and Metals (HINDCOPPER) showed strong bullish momentum. However, this strength was not sustained as the market saw widespread selling pressure on Thursday and Friday, particularly in high-volume names like IDEA and SUZLON. Most bullish signals from earlier in the week were invalidated by this downturn. The key takeaway is the need for a cautious approach, prioritizing stocks that demonstrated clear relative strength or reversal signals during Friday's sell-off.\",\n  \"trades\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"buy\",\n      \"symbol\": \"ASHOKLEY\",\n      \"shares\": 35,\n      \"amount\": 4967.55,\n      \"reason\": \"The stock showed significant resilience on a weak market day (Friday), forming a classic hammer candlestick pattern on high volume.
