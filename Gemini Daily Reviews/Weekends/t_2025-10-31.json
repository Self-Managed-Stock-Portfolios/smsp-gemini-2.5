Early-week momentum in sectors like metals and PSUs saw powerful, high-volume breakouts in stocks like IDBI and SAIL. However, the key theme was the failure of these breakouts to sustain momentum, as seen in the sharp reversals of VBL, SAIL, and CREDITACC within 1-2 days of their signals. This price action confirms a difficult environment for chasing strength and underscores the need for a cautious, selective approach. By the end of the week, the most resilient stocks were those in the PSU space (BEL, IDBI) that either held their gains or recovered strongly from dips, suggesting this is where institutional interest remains most stable. The strategy for the upcoming week is to cautiously deploy capital into these resilient names while avoiding aggressive entries on single-day breakouts.\",\n  \"trades\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"buy\",\n      \"symbol\": \"BEL\",\n      \"shares\": 18,\n      \"amount\": 7669.80,\n      \"reason\": \"Demonstrated consistent strength throughout the week, closing near its weekly high on massive volume.
