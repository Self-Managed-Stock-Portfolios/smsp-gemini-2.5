While several high-volume PSU and infrastructure stocks like RVNL and BEL faced selling pressure (opening high and closing low), strong buying interest emerged in select consumer discretionary and financial names. The key theme was stock-specific momentum, identified by strong bullish candlestick patterns like those in JUBLFOOD and CHOLAFIN, where buyers maintained control throughout the day. This suggests a selective approach is warranted, focusing on stocks demonstrating clear intraday strength rather than broad market trends.\",\n  \"top_signals\": [\n    {\n      \"symbol\": \"JUBLFOOD\",\n      \"signal\": \"Monitor for Bullish Entry\",\n      \"reason\": \"The stock formed a strong bullish candle, closing at \u20b9630.40, just shy of its daily high of \u20b9632.60. This price action, where the close is near the peak of the day's range, indicates sustained buying pressure and minimal profit-taking into the close. Its price point is well-suited for a small portfolio, allowing for meaningful position sizing. A potential entry could be considered on a move above today's high, confirming momentum.\",\n      \"price\": 630.40\n    },\n    {\n      \"symbol\": \"CHOLAFIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"Watch for Breakout\",\n      \"reason\": \"CHOLAFIN displayed a powerful bullish signal by opening at its exact low for the day (\u20b91611.00) and closing strong at \u20b91630.20. This 'Open=Low' formation is a classic indicator of overwhelming buyer dominance from the start of the session. It suggests that every dip was bought, and sellers were absent. A move above the day's high of \u20b91640.00 would serve as a strong confirmation for a potential breakout.\",\n      \"price\": 1630.20\n    },\n    {\n      \"symbol\": \"DEEPAKNTR\",\n      \"signal\": \"Potential Momentum Play\",\n      \"reason\": \"This stock exhibited a significant intraday reversal and high volatility.

The strong close at \u20b91869.40, well above its open, indicates a powerful shift in sentiment and a strong influx of buyers during the session.
